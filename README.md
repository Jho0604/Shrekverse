There are many movies in the *Shrek* universe. Currently, there are 4 mainline movies, 2 holiday TV specials, and 2 spin-off feature-length films. Besides official films the *Shrek* franchise also has a rather influential impact on modern culture; [Shrek the Musical](https://playbill.com/production/shrek-the-musical-broadway-theatre-vault-0000012248)—a musical based on the first film, [Shrek Retold](https://youtu.be/pM70TROZQsI?si=KqP2z7sK-7pTTpWv)—a fan recreation of the original film, and many [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/shrek) online all signifies the significance of this series in pop culture. In this blog, I will discuss my personal opinions on the mainline films and some of the other variations of them.

The original film *Shrek* made in 2001 was amazing and revolutionary. It was goofy. A good subversion of classic fairytales unseen by other mainstream animation studios. This movie contains the majority of classic scenes like Shrek getting ready to the Smash Mouth song [*All Star*](https://youtu.be/L_jWHffIx5E?si=wDXCfuPA20Vzk8k2), the line "some of you may die, but that's a sacrifice I am willing to make," and Fiona's singing exploding a bird. All of which can be seen as jabs against Disney's brand when it comes to their business and movies. The best part of Shrek is that for a movie made in 2001, it hasn't become jaded and is still enjoyable to watch now and again.

## [Shrek 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_shrek%25202)

Made 3 years after the original in 2004, the first sequel to *Shrek* was made. As a sequel, it does exceptionally well at preserving the original message of the first film and making meaningful additions to the universe of *Shrek* interestingly and compellingly. For example the kingdom of "Far Far Away" makes sense for the world-building of the universe, it answers the question: "If Fiona is a princess, to what kingdom is she royalty?" this builds the world without making the addition feel out of place. The only thing that does feel weird though is how Puss in Boots is brought into the story, he's hired to assassinate Shrek, but after he fails he just kinda sticks around. Although overall it's fine since he works well for the group dynamic between Shrek and Donkey.

## [Shrek the Third](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413267/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_shrek%25203)

It's pretty mid ngl. The new characters don't mesh well with the old ones and the plot feels forced with some pretty bad character motivation to push it. There are some good moments, but it's not enough to make the movie that good.

## [Shrek Forever After](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892791/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_shrek%2520for)

It's ok. Not as enjoyable as the first or second movie, but is more intresting of a plotline than the thrid. Me personally, I would have named the movie "Shrek 4ever After" or "Shrek fourever After," but whatever. I like how this is like someone's AU fanfiction, that's silly.
