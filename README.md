There are many movies in the *Shrek* universe. Currently there are 4 mainline movies, 2 holiday TV specials, and 2 spin-off feature length films. Besides official films the *Shrek* franchise also has a rather influential impact on modern culture; [Shrek the Musical](https://playbill.com/production/shrek-the-musical-broadway-theatre-vault-0000012248)—a musical based on the first film, [Shrek Retold](https://youtu.be/pM70TROZQsI?si=KqP2z7sK-7pTTpWv)—a fan recreation of the original film, and many [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/shrek) online all signifies the significance of this series in pop culture. In this blog I will discuss my personal opinions on the mainline films and some of the other variations of it.

The original film *Shrek* made in 2001 was an amazing and revolutionary film. It was goofy. A good subversion of classic fairytales unseen by other mainstream animation studios. This movie contain the majority of classic scenes like Shrek getting ready to the Smash Mouth song [*All Star*](https://youtu.be/L_jWHffIx5E?si=wDXCfuPA20Vzk8k2), the line "some of you may die, but that's a sacrifice I am willing to make," and Fiona's singing exploding a bird. All of which can be seen as jabs against Disney's brand when it comes to their business.
